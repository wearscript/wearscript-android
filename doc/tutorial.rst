Using the Playground
---------------------
The playground is a webapp that connects with WearScript while it is running on Glass.  It allows you to execute scripts and visualize the sensors/images from Glass.

* Go to the playground page for the server you'd like to use (if it's your first time, you'll sign into your Google account)
* After authorizing the webapp with Google, click the QR button the top right
* Ensure that Glass has an internet connection, WiFi is highly recommended
* There are two options to authenticate your glass

    * An ADB command will be shown, paste that into our console (it adds the server/auth key you need)
    * Use the WearScript (Setup) activity to scan the QR code

* On Glass, open up Launchy (go to the far left, tap settings, now you are in Launchy)
* Select WearScript (Start)
* If successfull, the buttons on the bottom of the Playground will enable.
* You may now send scripts, two examples are provided (you can click Wear This Script or Wear Script From URL)
